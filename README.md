A TIME SERIES-BASED HOTSPOT DETECTION IN VIRTUALIZED ENVIRONMENT
===============================================================
Project Description:
--------------------
The A-TIME-SERIES-BASED-HOTSPOT-DETECTION-IN-VIRTUALIZED-ENVIRONMENT project aims to address the issue of hotspot occurrences in virtualized environments by implementing a time-series-based analysis technique. Hotspots are situations where there is an abnormal increase in demand for cloud resources within a short period, potentially leading to performance degradation and imbalance in resource utilization.

Step 1: Install Xen-Server on your server hardware.
Step 2: Set up network and storage settings.
Step 3: Create virtual networks for communication between virtual machines and the external network.
Step 4: Create virtual machines, install operating systems on them, and configure resource pooling, high availability, resource allocation, backup, and security measures.
By following these steps, you can set up and manage your Citrix Xen environment effectively.

Hardware Requirements:
----------------------
- Processor: Intel or AMD x86 compatible processor with a minimum of 2 cores (recommended: 4 cores or more).
- RAM: Minimum 4 GB (recommended: 8 GB or more).
- Storage: Sufficient free disk space for the operating system, Citrix Xen installation, and virtual machines (exact requirements may vary based on usage).

Software Requirements:
----------------------
- Operating System: Compatible with Citrix Xen (e.g., Windows Server, Linux distributions).
- Hypervisor: Support for the desired hypervisor (e.g., Citrix Hypervisor, VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V).
- Networking: Adequate network connectivity for communication between the host system, virtual machines, and network infrastructure.
- Citrix Xen Installation Package: Download the appropriate version of Citrix Xen from the official Citrix website or authorized sources.

Key Features:
-------------
The project offers the following key features:
- Time-series-based Analysis: The project utilizes time-series analysis techniques to monitor resource utilization patterns in the virtualized environment.
- Hotspot Detection: The system detects hotspots by identifying abnormal spikes or surges in resource demands.
- Threshold Calculation: An Inter Quartile Range (IQR) algorithm is used to calculate thresholds for identifying hotspot occurrences.
- Virtual Machine Migration: When a hotspot is detected, the system triggers the migration of virtual machines from overloaded physical machines to underutilized ones.
- Performance Optimization: By redistributing resources and balancing the load, the system aims to improve overall performance and minimize downtime.

Project Description:
---------------------
**1) IQR Algorithm**:
This algorithm is used to identify the overloaded virtual machine that needs to be migrated from one physical machine to another. It follows these steps:
1. Take the CPU utilization of each virtual machine as input.
2. Sort the CPU utilization values in ascending order.
3. Divide the sorted array into two equal halves.
4. Calculate Quartile2 (Q2) as the middle value of the sorted array.
5. Calculate Quartile1 (Q1) as the center element of the first half and Quartile3 (Q3) as the center element of the second half.
6. Compute the Inter Quartile Range (IQR) value as the difference between Q3 and Q1.
7. Multiply the IQR value by a safety parameter (s) (in this case, 1.5) to obtain the threshold value.
8. Subtract the multiplied value from 1 to obtain the threshold value.
9. Compare each CPU utilization value to the threshold value.
10. Consider any virtual machine with a CPU utilization greater than the threshold as overloaded and in need of migration.

**2) Xen as Hypervisor**:
Xen was chosen as the hypervisor for the virtualized environment. It provides the following advantages:
1. Creates a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) or hypervisor, allowing multiple operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware simultaneously.
2. Supports different types of virtualizations, including para-virtualization, OS virtualization, and full virtualization.
3. Provides services to coordinate hardware access and requests from guest operating systems.
4. Enables live migration of virtual machines between physical hosts, allowing workload balancing and minimizing downtime.
5. Supports various guest operating systems and cloud platforms.
6. Integrates well with existing networking and storage infrastructures.

**3) Time Series-Based Analysis**:
This analysis technique involves periodically monitoring the CPU usage of all virtual machines within a physical machine. The CPU usage is observed over a fixed time, such as 10 minutes. After each period, the IQR algorithm is applied to determine if any virtual machine's CPU usage exceeds the threshold value. If any virtual machine is found to be overloaded, it is identified as the virtual machine to be migrated.

Conclusion:
------------
Overall, the "A TIME SERIES BASED HOTSPOT DETECTION IN VIRTUALIZED ENVIRONMENT" project offers an effective solution to address hotspot occurrences in virtualized environments, improving performance, resource utilization, and overall system stability.
